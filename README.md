Synopsis
-Viral Production
-Produced in LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) Environment
-Bootstrap 
-Javascript
-JQuery
-Javascript Library known as Vex was used for alert messages

Purpose:Showcase my front-end and back-end skills. 


-This project contains a user-login form, with one username and password. An error message is given when the user enters the wrong password. 
A table was created for the user login. To avoid redundancy a sign up page was not included

-It includes an about-us page which shows my ability to use Bootstrap at a high level, writing a Carousel Code. 

-It also includes two pages where you can shop for medication or vitamins. Each page includes its own javascript, and respective PHP code. 
The javascript is used to allow users to click the buttons when a valid number is entered into the <input type= number> fields
The PHP code adds the respective product to its respective table. There are two tables for products:medtable and vitaminstable. 

-A checkout page was also included which allows users to see the items that were purchased. This was done by "echoing" all respective HTML content
and accessing data from databuse using POST method. 
All data can be edited and total subtotal was calculated. When the user hits the purchase button, an option to see my Resume is given.
The alert message is given to the user, whether or not they would like to See My Resume, which opens up a PDF of my Resume. 
-Signout page warns user that all data will be deleted if signed out
